# Open Pit Mine Autonomous Bot

The project was focused on developing an unmanned ground vehicle for working in the environment of open - pit mines.The proposed vehicle would be easily able to maneuver along the path of the pit autonomously, transporting ores or disposing waste rocks to the dumping ground. Due to robust localization technique the vehicle could operate in remote areas without any external help.
